    </b><br> If you are reading this, we understand you are already interested to learn a technology field. But,we have repeatedly noticed that this decision is made based on wrong assumptions. For example,  some people assume it is an easy shortcut to get a
    well paying job with in 3 months. IT IS NOT!! Please start by watching this video to clearly understand WHY you have to learn a technology field.
    </p>
<!--step 2-->

        <p><b> What is the difference</b><br> between the online and the in class course?  Only the medium of teaching is different. Everything else is  the same. </p>
        <p><b>How are the online classes given?

           <p class="interview-one">Introduction</p> 
            <br>Rather than create a situation where one  leader mentors an entire group, we prefer to  create more meaningful, one-on-one relationships that leave the opportunity open for greater depth and impact. </p>
        <p><b>What is it?</b><br>It is a network formed by people who believe in the  power of collaboration with a  common goal of nurturing one  another to grow together. </p>
        <p><b>How is it different?</b><br>While most networks focus exclusively on growing the  largest network possible, Evangadi Networks strongly  believes in the power of  cultivating deeper, more meaningful connections  between members.  </p>

        <p><b>Who can join?</b><br>Anyone who believes in the  power of collaboration can join the network; the only requirement is the  understanding that collaboration is a two-way transaction. </p>
        <p><b>What is the Vision?</b><br>In the short term, we want to stay focused on helping everyone in the network improve their skills and knowledge in the digital  world.   </p>
        <p><b>The on-boarding steps</b><br>Since we are aiming to create a deeper
            relationship among members, it is critical to
            identify and match people with similar interests
            and goals.
            </p>
        <p><b>What happens here?</b><br>When someone decides to  join, they will be asked a  series of questions to help us  determine the best way to   place that person within the system  </p>
        <p><b>Who does the matching?</b><br>Most placement is handled automatically by the algorithm  on our website. In some unique cases where the algorithm cannot find a perfect fit, leaders of the groups will take a look and help the newcomer find a perfect mentor that matches their needs. </p>
